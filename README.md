# TypeScript-Notes
## TypeScript Introduction 
TypeScript is typed JavaScript. TypeScript adds types to JavaScript to help you speed up the development by catching errors before you even run the JavaScript code.  
TypeScript is an open-source programming language that builds on top of JavaScript. It works on any web browser, any OS, and any environment that JavaScript runs.  
1. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript.  
2. TypeScript builds on top of JavaScript. First, you write the TypeScript code. Then, you compile the TypeScript code into plain JavaScript code using a TypeScript compiler.  
3. Once you have the plain JavaScript code, you can deploy it to any environment that JavaScript runs.  
4. TypeScript files use the .ts extension rather than the .js extension of JavaScript files.

5. TypeScript uses the JavaScript syntaxes and adds additional syntaxes for supporting Types.
6. If you have a JavaScript program without any syntax errors, it is a TypeScript program. This means that all JavaScript programs are TypeScript programs. This is very helpful if you migrate an existing JavaScript codebase to TypeScript.

## Why TypeScript
The main goals of TypeScript are:
1. Introduce optional types to JavaScript.
2. Implement planned features of future JavaScript, a.k.a. ECMAScript Next or ES Next to the current JavaScript.

### TypeScript improves your productivity while helping avoid bugs
Types increase productivity by helping you avoid many mistakes. By using types, you can catch bugs at the compile time instead of having them occur at runtime.<br /><br />
For example, the following function adds two numbers x and y:<br />
`
function add(x, y) {
   return x + y;
}
`<br /><br />
If you get the values from HTML input elements and pass them into the function, you may get an unexpected result:<br />
`let result = add(input1.value, input2.value);
console.log(result); // result of concatenating strings`  

For example, if users entered **10** and **20**, the **add()** function would return **1020**, instead of **30**.  

The reason is that **input1.value** and **input2.value** are **strings**, not **numbers**. When you use the operator **+** to add two strings, it concatenates them into a single string.  

When you use TypeScript to specify the type for the parameters like this explicitly:  
`
function add(x: number, y: number) {
   return x + y;
}
`  

In this function, we added the number types to the parameters. The function **add()** will accept only numbers, not any other values.

When you invoke the function as follows:<br />
`
let result = add(input1.value, input2.value);
`<br /><br />
The TypeScript compiler will issue an error if you compile the **TypeScript** code into **JavaScript**. Hence, you can prevent the error from happening at runtime.  

### TypeScript brings the future JavaScript to today
TypeScript supports the upcoming features planned in the ES Next for the current JavaScript engines. It means you can use the new JavaScript features before web browsers (or other environments) fully support them. <br />

### Summary
1. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript.
2. TypeScript adds type to the JavaScript and helps you avoid potential bugs that occur at runtime.
3. TypeScript also implements the future features of JavaScript.

## Setup
1. Install Node.js
2. Install typescript: `npm install -g typescript` <br/>
Check typescript compiler version: `tsc --v` <br/>
3. If you want to run TypeScript code directly on Node.js without precompiling, you can use the tsx module: `npm install -g tsx` <br/>

### Summary
1. A TypeScript compiler compiles the TypeScript into JavaScript.
2. Use the tsc command to compile a TypeScript file to a JavaScript file.
3. Use the tsx module to run TypeScript directly on Node.js without precompiling it to JavaScript.

## TypeScript “Hello, World!”
1. Create a new directory to store the code, e.g., helloworld.
2. Create a new TypeScript file called app.ts. The extension of a TypeScript file is .ts
3. Type the following source code in the app.ts file:<br/>
`let message: string = 'Hello, World!';
console.log(message);`
4. Type the following command on the Terminal to compile the app.ts file:<br/>
`tsc app.ts`
5. If everything is fine, you’ll see a new file called `app.js` is generated by the TypeScript compiler.
6. To run the app.js file in Node.js, you use the following command:<br/>
`node app.js`
7. If you installed the tsx module, you can use just one command to run the TypeScript file directly on Node.js without precompiling it to JavaScript:<br/>
`tsx app.ts`

## TypeScript Benefits
1. TypeScript adds a type system to help you avoid many problems with dynamic types in JavaScript.
2. TypeScript implements the future features of JavaScript a.k.a ES Next so you can use them today.

## Dynamic Types in JavaScript
JavaScript is dynamically typed. Unlike statically typed languages such as Java or C#, values have types instead of variables.<br/><br/>
`let box;
box = "hello";
box = 100;`
<br/>
<br/>
The type of the box variable changes based on the value assigned to it.<br/>
To find the type of the box variable at runtime, you use the **typeof operator**<br/>
```
let box;
console.log(typeof(box)); // undefined

box = "Hello";
console.log(typeof(box)); // string

box = 100;
console.log(typeof(box)); // number
```
<br/>
The first statement defines a variable box without assigning a value in this example. Its type is undefined.<br/>
Then, we assign the literal string "Hello" to box variable and show its type. The type of the box variable changes to string.<br/>
Finally, we assign 100 to the box variable. This time, the type of the box variable changes to number.<br/>
As you can see, as soon as the value is assigned, the type of the variable changes.<br/>
And you don’t need to explicitly tell JavaScript the type. JavaScript will automatically infer the type from the value.<br/>
Dynamic types offer flexibility. However, they also lead to problems.<br/>

### Problems with dynamic types
Suppose you have a function that returns a product object based on an id:<br/>
```
function getProduct(id){
  return {
    id: id,
    name: `Awesome Gadget ${id}`,
    price: 99.5
  }
}
```
<br/>
The following uses the getProduct() function to retrieve the product with id 1 and show its data: <br/> 

```
const product = getProduct(1);
console.log(`The product ${product.Name} costs $${product.price}`);
```

<br/>
Output:<br/>
The product undefined costs $99.5 <br/>

It isn’t what we expected.<br/>

The issue with this code is that the product object doesn’t have the Name property. It has the name property with the first letter n in lowercase.
<br/>
However, you can only know it until you run the script. <br/>
Referencing a property that doesn’t exist on the object is a common issue when working in JavaScript. <br/>
The following example defines a new function that outputs the product information to the console: <br/>
```
const showProduct = (name, price)  => {
  console.log(`The product ${name} costs $${price}.`);
};
```
<br/>
The following uses the getProduct() and showProduct() functions: <br/>

```
const product = getProduct(1);
showProduct(product.price, product.name);
```

<br/>
The product 99.5 costs $Awesome Gadget 1 <br/>
This time we pass the arguments in the wrong order to the showProduct() function. This is another common problem that you often have when working with JavaScript.<br/>
This is why TypeScript comes into play.<br/>

### How Typescript solves problems of dynamic types
To fix the problem of referencing a property that doesn’t exist on an object, you do the following steps:<br/>

First, define the “shape” of the product object using an interface.<br/>
```
interface Product{
    id: number,
    name: string,
    price: number
};
```
<br/>

Second, explicitly use the Product type as the return type of the getProduct() function:<br/>
```
function getProduct(id) : Product{
  return {
    id: id,
    name: `Awesome Gadget ${id}`,
    price: 99.5
  }
}
```
<br/>
When you reference a property that doesn’t exist, the code editor will inform you immediately: <br/>

```
const product = getProduct(1);
console.log(`The product ${product.Name} costs $${product.price}`);
```

<br/>
The code editor highlighted the following error on the Name property<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
And when you hover the mouse cursor over the error, you’ll see a hint that helps you to solve the issue:<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
To solve the problem of passing the arguments in the wrong order, you explicitly assign types to function parameters: <br/>

```
const showProduct = (name: string, price:number)  => {
  console.log(`The product ${name} costs $${price}.`);
};
```

<br/>
And when you pass the arguments of the wrong types to the showProduct() function, you’ll receive an error: <br/><br/>

```
const product = getProduct(1);
showProduct(product.price, product.name);
```

<br/>

### Summary
1. JavaScript is dynamically typed, providing flexibility but also leading to many problems.
2. TypeScript adds an optional type system to JavaScript to solve these problems.

## TypeScript Types
### What is a type in TypeScript

In TypeScript, a type is a convenient way to refer to different properties and functions that a value has. <br/>
A value is anything you can assign to a variable e.g., a number, a string, an array, an object, and a function <br/>
For example, see the following value: `'Hello'` <br/>
When you look at this value, you can say it is a string. This value has properties and methods that a string has. <br/>

For example, the 'Hello' value has a property called length that returns the number of characters: <br/>
`console.log('Hello'.length); // 5`

It also has many methods like match(), indexOf(), and toLocaleUpperCase(). For example: <br/>
`console.log('Hello'.toLocaleUpperCase()); // HELLO` <br />

When you look at the value 'Hello' and describe it by listing the properties and methods, it would be inconvenient. <br />

A shorter way to refer to a value is to assign it a type. In this example, you say 'Hello' is a string. Then, you know that you can use the properties and methods of a string for the value 'Hello' <br />

In conclusion, in TypeScript:

1. a type is a label that describes the different properties and methods that a value has
2. every value has a type.

### Types in TypeScript
TypeScript inherits the built-in types from JavaScript. TypeScript types are categorized into:

1. Primitive types.
2. Object types.

### Primitive types

### Object Types
Object types are functions, arrays, classes, etc.

### Purposes of types in TypeScript
There are two main purposes of types in TypeScript:

1. First, types are used by the TypeScript compiler to analyze your code for errors.
2. Second, types allow you to understand what values are associated with variables.

### Summary
1. In TypeScript, every value is associated with a type.
2. A type is a label that describes the properties and methods that a value has.
3. TypeScript compiler uses types to analyze your code for hunting bugs and errors.

## Understanding Type Annotations in TypeScript
TypeScript uses type annotations to specify explicit types for identifiers such as variables, functions, objects, etc. <br/>

TypeScript uses the syntax : type after an identifier as the type annotation, which type can be any valid type. <br/>

Once an identifier is annotated with a type, it can be used as that type only. If the identifier is used as a different type, the TypeScript compiler will issue an error. <br/>

### Type annotations in variables and constants
The following syntax shows how to specify type annotations for variables and constants: <br/>
```
let variableName: type;
let variableName: type = value;
const constantName: type = value;
```
<br/> 
In this syntax, the type annotation comes after the variable or constant name and is preceded by a colon (:). <br/> 

The following example uses number annotation for a variable: <br/> 
`
let counter: number;
`
<br/> 
After this, you can only assign a number to the counter variable: <br/> 
`
counter = 1;
`
<br/> 
If you assign a string to the counter variable, you’ll get an error: <br/> 
```
let counter: number;
counter = 'Hello'; // compile error
```
<br/> 
Error: <br/> 
`
Type '"Hello"' is not assignable to type 'number'.
`
<br/> 
You can both use a type annotation for a variable and initialize it in a single statement like this: <br/> 
`let counter: number = 1;`
<br/> 
The following shows other examples of primitive type annotations: <br/> 
```
let name: string = 'John';
let age: number = 25;
let active: boolean = true;
```
<br/> 

## Type annotation examples
### Arrays

To annotate an array type you use a specific type followed by a square bracket : type[] : <br/>
```
let arrayName: type[];
```
 <br/>
For example, the following declares an array of strings: <br/>
```
let names: string[] = ['John', 'Jane', 'Peter', 'David', 'Mary'];
```
 <br/>

 ### Objects
To specify a type for an object, you use the object type annotation. For example: <br/>
```
let person: {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 25,
}; // valid

```
<br/>

In this example, the person object only accepts an object that has two properties: name with the string type and age with the number type.
